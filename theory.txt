Operations:
) Output a tree (recursive)
) Operations with a branch:
)) Insert <newB>
)) Update

)) Move <intoTargetB>
) Find B by "text" field"
) Get a branch by URL (getBbyURL)
  Ex.: "/b0/b00/b01/..."

===== with hash =====

Data structure:
  Branch
    subB = [hash1, hash2, ...]
    url = "/b0/b00/b01/..."

  Dict (hashTable)  
     hash | Branch
    ------+--------
     ...  | ...


Operations:
) Get a branch by URL (getBbyURL)
    hash(URL)
    find in hash table
) Operations with a branch:
)) Insert <newB>
    newHash = hash(B.url + newB.caption)

) Output a tree (recursive)
    ...
) Find B by "text" field"

===== with ordinary tables =====
Ordinary tables is good because of 
  - simplicity
  - possibility for fast full-text search

Data structure:
  Branch
    subB_id = [ id_1, id_2, ...]
    parent_id = id

Operations:
) Output a tree (recursive)
) Operations with a branch:
)) Insert <newB>
)) Update
)) Delete
)) Move <intoTargetB>
) Find B by "text" field"
) Get a branch by URL (getBbyURL)
  Ex.: "/b0/b00/b01/..."
